Lab-scale concrete pump made from plumbing parts and a linear actuator.

Initial testing version:

- High strength linear actuator pushes the piston
- Barrel: 4 inch (nominal ID) ABS pipe frame, 500mm long
- Neck: 4 inch to 2 inch solvent welded ABS tapered reducer
- Outlet: 2 inch pipe thread, many possible things could be attached, like various tubes/hoses, or even a positive displacement pump. 


3D printed components need to be at least PETG to survive concrete exposure: PLA cracks within minutes.
