# Volor 3D Printer

A CoreXY printer designed with a welded steel frame and steel linear rails.

There are only a few 3D printed parts of the frame, like the 'towers' that hold the T5 timing belt bearings to the frame.

Uses 5/16" or 8mm bolts to hold steel washers and 608 (skate) bearings on which the T5 timing belts run.  Requires a total of 18 special washers to let the bearings spin.  

Belt length is almost exactly 2 meters for 400mm rails, 350mm travel.  The belt plane is 20mm above the steel frame, and spaced 11mm on center above that.

I wired this with an old Melzi 2.0 control board, but any 3D printer or CNC control board will work.  cncjs works well as the user interface controller.
