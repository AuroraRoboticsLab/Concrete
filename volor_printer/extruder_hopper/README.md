= Concrete extruder based around a hopper and auger

Mostly 3D printed, using a steel wood drill bit as the auger, and a 1 inch steel pipe as the mixing tube.

The design is OpenSCAD with the BOSL2 library.

Initial test results from printing mud (basalt dust and bentonite clay) and a geopolymer mortar (fly ash and alkali):
- The printed material should be viscous but flow easily. Too sandy and the nozzle will pack solid.
- Maximum aggregate size should be 1/8" (3mm, #8 mesh), large aggregates wedge the auger against the pipe.
- In tacky material, the auger just cuts straight down through the material, hence the inducer spiral to push material down out of the hopper.

If you print this in PLA, it will work fine in mud but the strong alkali of concrete or mortar will crack it. I recommend PETG or ABS.
