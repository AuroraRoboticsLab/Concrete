# Cylinder Compression Test Frame

This wood frame can amplify the operator's weight by up to 15x, allowing unconfined compressive strength testing of even high strength 15mm x 30mm mortar or geopolymer cylinders. This is not intended to replace lab testing, but is for estimating the strength of novel mixtures with backyard technology.

The basic idea is that the cylinder is loaded 100mm from the pivot bolt, and by moving their weight farther from the pivot point, the operator can apply increasing force to the test cylinder.

For example, if the operator weighs 100 kg including shoes and safety gear, then standing 100 mm from the pivot point puts all 100 kgf down onto the test cylinder.  Standing 200 mm from the pivot point puts 200 kgf on the test cylinder, 300 mm puts 300 kgf on the test cylinder, and so on.  If the top beam is too short to give enough leverage to break the cylinder, the cylinder can be moved only 50 mm from the pivot, which doubles the above forces. 

Once the cylinder breaks, the operator drops only a short distance (but should still be careful to do this in a safe area, wearing appropriate protective equipment). 

Example:
*    15 mm x 30 mm ice-bonded mortar cylinder
*    Cylinder loaded 100mm from pivot bolt
*    Operator weight 100 kg including shoes and safety gear
*    Breaks at position 5x, 500mm from pivot point
*    Break force = 5x 100 kg = 500 kgf
*    Mortar unconfined compressive strength = 500 kgf / ((7.5mm)^2*pi) in MPa = 27 MPa (3,900 psi)

Being made from wood, this only gives a rough strength estimate, but can be quantitative to 1-2 significant figures to guide mixture development.  DO NOT USE THIS FOR BUILDINGS OR SAFETY CRITICAL STRENGTH TESTING.


## Assembly Process

The frame is made from wood in a convenient size, such as US 2x4 or metric 38x90 mm cross section.

The top and bottom beams should be 800 mm to 1100 mm long, and the top beam should be clear fine-grained lumber to take the bending forces. 

Compressive forces are taken by 5 mm thick (3/16 inch) steel plates.  A 25mm wide x 150mm long (1" x 6") plate worked.

The pivot bolt is a steel bolt or rod of at least 8mm (5/16") diameter.  It needs to be long enough to go through three frame sections, so at least 130mm (5") long. 

Two wood uprights are permanently fixed to the bottom beam.  The pivot bolt goes through the uprights, allowing the top beam to swing open easily.

The steel plates are fixed to the top and bottom beams using wood screws and glue. This is particularly critical for the top beam, where the uplift forces on the pivot point go through the steel and screws to get to the top beam. Countersinking the holes helps the wood screws hold to the steel. We found expanding polyurethane glue worked well to hold everything together.
